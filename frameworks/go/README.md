This is my very own very personal and (I'll expect) very modulable framework for large projects the proposite for this proyect is to be agnostic whatever the framework or boilerplate is used, also for provide full support for all HTML5 features and it's not supported yet provide alternatives from IE8+

We need to investigate this features :D
